Plots to add:

1) Counts / (mC * target_density) (luminosity), so we can compare different targets
2) total_counts (cumulative)


# ! # targetfac = convert mg/cm^2  to   nucleons / cm^2    luminosity (cm^2 s^-1)

# 6.022 * 1e^23 atoms / mol
# 1 g/mol = 1 amu
# 1 barn = 10^-28 m^2 (or 100 fm^2)
# target aeral density [g/cm^2]: rho [g/cm^3] *  target_length [cm]

[g/cm^2]



ex.  Be9 : 9.012182 amu  (or  9.012182 g/mol)
from D. Meekins table:  0.978 g/cm^2,   density: 1.848 g / cm^3,  real_thickness: 5 mm (0.5 cm), req thickness: 0.5292 cm
(real thickness is misleading, because it is not used, and one woudl think it is the one used for calculation)
(so it seems Meekins actually uses the columns "Thick" [g/cm^2] and "Density"[g/cm^3] to calculate "Req Thickness"[cm]



# In SIMC, the targetfac can be calculated by converting the aereal density [g/cm^2] to nucleons / cm ^2

For Be-9, for example:
targetfac = (Aereal_density * 1/ m_amu) * Na * #nucleons/atom
          = 0.978 g/cm^2 *  ( 1. mol / 9.012182 g ) * 6.022 * 1e^23 atoms / mol *  (9 nucleons / 1 Be9-atom) = 5.88 * 1e23 nucleons / cm^2 



luminosity = EXPER%charge/targetfac  =  (1/sig) * dN/dt,  where sig is the "cross section" and dN/dt is the event rate


so .. . . .    sig = (dN/dt) / (charge/targetfac) --> dimensional analysis gives:
                    (1/[sec]) / ([mC] / (#nucleons/cm^2 )) = sec^-1 cm^-2


Continuing the example of Be-9 . . .
targetfac = 5.88 * 1e23 nucleons / cm^2  * (1e-24 cm^2 / 1barn)  = 0.588 barns^-1


Now, say we have found Be9 to have a (e,e'p) rate for mean-field of dN/dt = 138 Hz, and charge accumulated of 80 mC, this means that
the rough cross section is: sig = 138 Hz / (80 mC / 0.588 barns^-1) = 1.0143 s^-1 barns^-1 per milliCoulomb




Interesting.  I looked at the 50k and 200k replay files for run 21072 under dir:  ./ROOTfiles/shms50k/
and did not find anything strange.  The pedestals are mostly within 125 to 145 mV, except blocks neighboring pmt 120

I think what happened is, that since this compares the pedestal to a golden run, it may be that at the time the golden
run was determined, we did not really use high stats, but rather a 50k replay, and it may have been that some of the
pedestals were missing due to low stats, and then when you replayed the high stats run, all of a sudden more blocks had
non-zero stats and was compared to a pedestal from before, which had zero stats, and so you get more pedestals that disagree
with the golden run.  

Maybe what should be done is to re-do the 200k replay but using the golden run flag, to redefine this run as golden and then compare
it to future runs.  You can do this as follows:
$ ./run_coin_shms.sh <run_number> <event_number> set-golden
